This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl related to the order of evaluation of the pre- and post-increment operators in combination with addition. The script `bug.pl` shows the unexpected result, while `bugSolution.pl` illustrates how to understand and correct the behavior.  The issue is rooted in Perl's operator precedence and the way the pre/post-increment operators modify their operands.
